**Bitcoin Script (2012)** 

**Bitcoin Script** is a simple programming language used to define the conditions under which Bitcoin transactions can execute.

Designed to be a lightweight, Turing-incomplete language to ensure security and predictability, Bitcoin Script was introduced in the 2008 whitepaper. Early on, Bitcoin Script was used mostly for basic transactions, with limited functionality beyond simple transfers. Over time, however, developers explored more complex use cases leading to innovations like multi-signature wallets, time-locked transactions, and rudimentary smart contracts. That said, due to security concerns and the desire for standardization, certain opcodes (operation codes) were disabled or restricted, and this limited expressiveness.

While being Turing-incomplete ensured a level of predictability, preventing infinite loops and complex computations that could jeopardize the network, it greatly limited Bitcoin Scriptâ€™s functionality. Developers craved a Turing-complete language suitable for writing more complex smart contracts. **Colored Coins** and the **Lightning Network** were efforts to bring innovation to Bitcoin but ultimately, its great strength remains its main weakness, a refusal to innovate or grow beyond being a reliable, secure store of value. This frustration would ultimately lead to the founding of Ethereum, our next topic.
