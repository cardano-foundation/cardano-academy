**Cardano’s origins (2015)** 

2015 was a busy year as it was also around this time that Charles Hoskinson conceived of the Cardano blockchain. From day one, Cardano’s mission was to improve upon previous generations by adopting a first principles, **academic research** approach. This involves rigorous processes with formal methods, mathematical specifications and proofs to deliver high-assurance software. In layman's terms, formal methods verify that things that were produced behave as intended.

Cardano is built on solid foundations. It has over 200 research papers published and scrutinized at the top cryptography conferences. In addition to solving the blockchain trilemma (decentralisation, security and scalability), Cardano also identified key areas as essential for mass adoption: **scalability, interoperability** with other ecosystems, and on-chain **governance**.  

The *Why Cardano* essay and *Cardano whiteboard* video by Charles Hoskinson explain the founding tenets of Cardano development. There is now a treasure chest of research papers, with many of the innovative ideas and solutions already implemented on Cardano mainnet. They have also inspired other projects.  

According to Google Scholar, the first published paper, *Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol*, has been cited more than 2,000 times. 

Professor Aggelos Kiayias joined as Chief Science Officer in 2016 and led a careful analysis of the existing landscape before any design decisions were made. The initial research focussed on performing a critical analysis of the UTxO and account-based blockchains. The first block on the Cardano network was minted on September 23, 2017, at 11:44:51 PM to be precise.
