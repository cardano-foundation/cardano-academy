Sections should be concise, with topics covered in chronological order ideally. Best to keep to the same overall analogy throughout the book.

- Solidity and Aiken are relatively easy to learn, challenge is to explain eUTxO and master on-chain / off-chain interaction.
- Pycardano: while not high insurance code, Pycardano is easier for students to understand the concepts. Python used a lot in educational sector, but not industry.
