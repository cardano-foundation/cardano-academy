**Ethereum (2013)**

In 2013, a 19 year old named Vitalik Buterin published a whitepaper proposing a new blockchain that went beyond Bitcoin's simple transaction capabilities. Its name… Ethereum. 

The term 'world computer' was coined to describe Buterin's vision for Ethereum to be a globally accessible, decentralized platform for running applications and storing data. In 2014, Buterin's ideas attracted a group of talented individuals who became Ethereum's co-founders. Among them were Gavin Wood, the key developer behind Solidity, Ethereum's Turing-complete programming language and Charles Hoskinson, who helped set up the Ethereum Foundation. 

On July 30th 2015, the Ethereum network went live. At the official launch event in Berlin, Vitalik Buterin famously wore a t-shirt with lines of code printed on it. This code represented a simplified version of the ‘Greeter’ contract, one of the first basic smart contracts on Ethereum.

At the core of Ethereum is the EVM, or Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts aren't run on your computer but on virtual machines that provide a safe sandbox with safeguards and specific capabilities to execute smart contracts. For example, virtual machines can give precise estimates of resources required for your program.

Ethereum also introduced the account-based model which should be intuitive to anyone with a bank account. It works similarly: if my balance is 10 ETH and yours is 2 ETH, and I send 3 ETH to you, then your balance would be credited to 5 ETH and mine debited to 7 ETH. There is a little more to it, but just understand this high level view for now.
