# Unit 1 - General Introduction and Background

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to:

- Describe decentralization and its importance
- Describe how consensus algorithms in a decentralized system provide a mechanism to reach agreement without a central authority
- Describe the decentralization challenges, such as scalability, throughput, and latency 
- Summarize how Blockchain technology introduces a new consensus algorithm class contributing to the decentralization challenges.
