## What & How Can You Contribute?

### Feedback

Contributions in the form of feedback and issues are very much welcome. Whether it may be a suggestion, contributing an infographic, or maybe some questions that you have. It helps in improving the course(s) over time and these are the best kind of contributions to start with.

Do not hesitate to add *thumbs up* üëç on suggestions you support to show your interest.

Any updates, typo fixes, or expansion of the course content is more than welcome. Note however that courses are generally targeted at beginner, intermediate, advanced audiences.

Pull requests are welcome, but we do recommend you open an issue to bring any idea to discussion first! Especially if the pull request will end up very large, any significant changes should be discussed up front with the maintainers. This avoids awkward situations where someone puts in a bunch of work to ultimately have the pull request closed due to a potential variety of unforeseen reasons.

### Changelog

Please add an entry into CHANGELOG.md when submitting changes. New entries should be in the format `[next] DD--MM--YYYY` section. This let's us keep track of unreleased changes for future course iterations. 

Each release section will be further broken down into three sections named Added, Changed, and Removed. 

```
## [next] - DD--MM--YYYY

### Added

- some new thing

### Changed

- fixed or updated something

### Removed

- something is gone now
```
