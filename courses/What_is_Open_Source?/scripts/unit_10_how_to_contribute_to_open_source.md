# How to Contribute to Open Source

Many people hear about open source and think: "This sounds great, I would like to contribute!". Yet, the task may rapidly feel overwhelming. Large open-source projects can span over millions of lines of code, thousands of modules and hundreds of active contributors. How does one make sense of such an accrued magnitude of code? And what does it even mean to 'contribute' after all? What if you're not a software engineer? Can you still contribute to a project? In the upcoming sections, we'll build an intuition for these questions and review some types of possible contributions.

## Types of contributions  

When we think of contributing to open source, writing code is the most obvious example. This is hardly surprising, given that the people using open-source software are typically developers. Often, a developer will find a tool that's almost perfect for their project but is missing one or two key features. 

Instead of starting over, they can build those features themselves. It's also common for them to find a bug and submit a patch to fix it. This creates a clear win-win scenario: one person shares a large body of work for free, saving others time and money. In return, making a contribution to improve that work is a practical way to give back and enhance the solution for everyone.

If you want to contribute to open source, it may be useful to know that code contributions aren't necessarily what maintainers are looking for at first, especially in the early phases of a project. It is rather complicated to reconcile code written by many developers. This is generally possible only when software has matured sufficiently and after architectural patterns and habits have emerged. 

New software is usually more fragile, and maintainers tend to be careful about including additions that may not account for the bigger picture. 

So, while it may sound the most obvious, it is best to always look for what maintainers are looking for first. We will come back to this shortly.

Nevertheless, code contributions can also happen without explicitly writing code. Code reviews, for example, are essential to reducing defects and improving overall code quality. Sparing an eye to helping peer review the work of others can be genuinely beneficial to a project and is often an excellent way to get started with code changes. Watching how others do it, their habits, conventions, etc., before doing any substantial work is tremendously beneficial.
