# Why Choose Open Source?

So far, we've primarily described what open source is and where it came from. Yet, why did this movement appear to begin with?  We could summarise the motivations behind open source in a simple statement: building software is a complicated endeavour, so it's better done together. In many aspects, open source is an attempt at building better, more robust software faster. It emphasises sharing and collaboration, which thus encourages improvements and iterations of existing software from various sources.

In contrast, proprietary software is often driven only by one company's priorities. Sometimes, it is even simpler for companies to provide extra support to users than to fix or rework an existing piece of software. Let's see this clearly and delve into the value and benefits of having an open-source strategy.

## Open source as a development methodology 

Open source is, first and foremost, a development methodology. It is an approach which favours frequent releases and short iteration cycles. It is inherently agile, as users drive requirements and roadmap unpredictably.

There aren't two identical open-source projects. Some projects may be dormant until a particular life event makes them suddenly popular, drawing attention from many developers simultaneously. Some others may sustain a constant activity and steady development. 

Yet, what's common to all is how maintainers must constantly adapt to their users. Some will report bugs or request assistance, some will ask for specific features, and others may propose or implement new features.

As a result, through well-defined processes, constant efforts from open-source maintainers and sometimes a bit of magic, projects evolve organically in a very agile manner into something useful to many. 

For this to happen, open-source projects must have clear contribution guidelines and accessible instructions for building, developing and testing the project. Because a project is only instrumental if it has users, successful open-source projects are also those that make it easy for their users. 

This means providing good interface references, tutorials, user manuals, installation instructions, and other documentation that is relevant to the project. Some projects even document their design decisions through approaches such as Architectural Decision Records to make the work of future maintainers simpler.

Adopting an open-source strategy is a means to enforce best practices for many organisations. Who would not want a project – even internal – to be well-documented and accessible? By following an open-source approach, organisations reduce the risk of a project becoming hard to maintain. They enforce an excellent separation between software components and ensure that software quality converges towards excellence. 

With many users and contributors chiming in, software only becomes more robust. Indeed, people may run into unidentified software defects or inaccurate documentation pieces. So, the more eyes, the merrier.
