# Understanding Open Source Licenses
Every open-source software is licensed under the terms of an open-source license. A license serves multiple purposes. 

First, it protects the authors and contributors of open-source software by typically limiting the liabilities and warranties coming with the software. 

Open-source code is often provided "as-is", and inspecting any code included as part of a larger work is highly recommended.

Second, it protects the users of open-source software by granting them explicit permissions and rights without legal repercussions.

Hence, a license usually specifies elements around three core axes:

Permissions are rights granted to the user by the license. This typically covers commercial usage, distribution, modification, patenting and private use; Conditions specify under which terms are the aforementioned permissions granted; Limitations cover liabilities, warranties and trademark uses.

Finally, licenses usually fall into two categories: copyleft and permissive, which we’ll talk about next.
