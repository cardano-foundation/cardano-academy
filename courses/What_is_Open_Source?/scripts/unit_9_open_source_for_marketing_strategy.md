# Open Source for Marketing Strategy

The impact of an open-source strategy on an organisation’s brand  can be a driving factor. In the same way that a furnished portfolio increases your chances of getting a job, open-source projects can showcase organizations from a technical standpoint. Hence, open source also exists as a means to attract talent. Significant open-source contributions stand out. 

They demonstrate an organisation's ability to work collaboratively and transparently and can also convey ideas of software quality and working standards better than any discourse.

Some companies have become known through their open-source projects, fast-tracking the companies as software industry leaders and pioneers. Netflix, for example, is widely known for its "Chaos Monkey", a resiliency tool meant to harden large infrastructure by randomly turning off live components of a production environment – as if one would unleash a monkey in a data-center. This tool exposes organisations and their engineering departments to failures more frequently than usual, ensuring that they can promptly recover from failures – should they be induced or from natural causes. Besides pointing to a fascinating piece of engineering, this story makes for a great marketing pitch. The impact of Chaos Monkey has indeed piqued the curiosity of many software engineers around the world.
