# Design and Marketing Considerations

Some open-source projects focus entirely on design. For example, FontAwesome and Feather offer a bank of well-crafted icons ready for any project to supercharge its user interface with beautiful icons instantly. 

Google's Material Design is another successful example of an entire open-source design system. Over the years, the project has spearheaded countless conversations and studies on user experience and how to build proper user interfaces.

Popular open-source projects like Google's Material may even become a brand. Think, for example, about React, a widely adopted frontend framework for building user interfaces. React has become so popular that job ads frequently call for "React Developers". WordPress is another major industry brand that needs no introduction. In breakout instances, design plays a critical role. An attractive website with illustrative diagrams or helpful animations makes for a valuable user experience. A logo with a strong identity inspires confidence and attracts users and businesses. Beyond just "looking cool", effective design signals that a project has or aspires to independence.

## Marketing 

The impact of design on a project naturally leads us to consider the way someone can contribute to a project - marketing. Oftentimes, open-source projects start from simple ideas. They make someone's life easier. They are made public in case others would benefit from a similar solution. Yet, as they become popular,  they develop customers, stakeholders, roadmaps, identity and many traits that make them akin to products Subsequently, they demand more work and effort to maintain and build businesses around.

As a consequence of the growing complexity, the need to attract new users grows as well. Projects often struggle to get their first critical users as many organisations still see open-source as a lower quality sandbox than so-called "enterprise software". Hence, it's common to see organisations standing in the back, waiting for someone else to take the first leap of faith and use open-source software in production. 

Adoption is much easier after a few success stories, and in the meantime, marketing plays an important role.

Many brilliant open-source projects die off because no one gets to see them. Any project’s success does require some amount of luck, however, efficient marketing can help provoke the necessary luck once in a while. In this context, marketing can take various forms, from 'spreading the word' to organising live events focused around a particular project. Articles, newsletters and testimonies can generate incredible momentum for projects — especially success stories. 

Maintainers, often too busy building software and improving their tools, may neglect this opportunity and benefit greatly from help with promotion.
