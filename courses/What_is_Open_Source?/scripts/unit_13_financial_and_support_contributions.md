# Financial and Support Contributions

So far, we've seen various contribution areas for various skill sets. Yet, what about situations where you are interested in contributing to a project but do not have the skillset or the time it demands to make valuable contributions? Or what if there's no need for your particular skill set because the project is at a phase where it doesn't need that particular skill set? Financial support can also be a practical contribution depending on the project's aspirations. It is standard to see sponsoring programs near open-source projects. Various platforms exist, for that matter, such as Github Sponsors or Open Collective.

Some projects are also part of larger groups, such as foundations, which usually have membership programs and various ways of accepting financial contributions. Sometimes, it's easier to let projects decide for themselves where they need to pull resources. Often, project maintainers only work part-time or are just plain benevolent, for they cannot sustain themselves financially through a project. Platforms like Buy Me A Coffee also encourage people to support projects through small donations. 

This is a nice gesture that can have a positive impact on maintainers. A coffee and a small appreciation note can change someone's day radically, particularly when they prevent countless work hours and trouble ahead of you.
Support 

Finally, we will conclude this tour of contributions with an aspect that is also too often overlooked: technical support. Paradoxically, this is where open source shines almost at its best. This is what makes open source such an attractive model. Open source is, before all, a community-oriented approach. Building a community is challenging, yet a strong community that looks to each other is precious. 

In the closed-source world, users usually expect technical support from the organisation selling the software. And there's only so much that a single entity can do.

In open source, the entire world is the technical support desk. All the other users and contributors who have gone through the same issues can help. In general, support tickets are even publicly available or happen on public forums such as Discord or StackExchange. 

Since everything there's to know about a project is publicly available, any enthusiast may build a deep understanding of a project. 

Coupled with past experiences, this means users are very capable of helping each other without any help from core project maintainers. When communities reach levels where they can support each other, nothing can stop them. During the early phases of a project, it is often up to the maintainers to help and guide people through. Yet, as the project and community matures, their role steadily shifts towards providing the community with better resources to help themselves.
