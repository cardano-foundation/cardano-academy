# Intro

Welcome to the Cardano Academy and our course on Open Source.

In this short introduction, I'll answer four key questions. First, why did we create this course and why is it so important? Second, who's the audience for this course? Third, who are we at the Academy? And fourth, what will you learn?

The first question is, why did we create this course? Well, we built this course because the world is moving towards a more open, transparent, and decentralized future—often called Web3. To build this new internet, we need new ways of working together.

Open source is that way. It’s the practical and philosophical foundation for building software collaboratively and transparently. Understanding how it works is more important than ever for anyone involved in technology or innovation.

The second question is, who's the audience for this course?

If you're curious about the collaborative, decentralized engine that powers much of the technology you use every day, then you've come to the right place. We've designed this course for a wide audience. 

So whether you're a newcomer to Cardano, a business manager looking to leverage community-driven innovation, or a software developer wanting to contribute to a project, you're in the right place.

The course should take about an hour, and it's divided into 19 short microlessons that you can complete whenever it suits you.

Now, the third question, who are we? We are the Cardano Academy, the official educational body of the Cardano Foundation. Our mission is to empower a global community with expert-led, open-source education on blockchain and its related technologies. 

We believe that knowledge should be accessible to all so this course is free, designed to give you clear, practical insights into the open-source world.

Final question, what will you learn?

We’ll start by diving into what "open source" really means and explore the important distinctions between that and "free software."

Next, we’ll focus on the different licenses that control how projects can be used and shared, analyzing the core differences between copyleft and permissive licenses.

Then, you'll discover that contributing isn't just for coders. We'll explore the many ways you can make an impact, from improving documentation and design to helping with marketing.

Finally, we’ll look at how successful projects are managed. You’ll evaluate various governance and business models to understand what keeps a project sustainable for the long term and learn how to navigate real-world challenges like maintainer burnout.

And don't worry about the terminology; there's a glossary included to help you with any terms you're not familiar with. By the end of this course, you’ll have a clear strategy for how you can participate in and contribute to the open-source ecosystem.
