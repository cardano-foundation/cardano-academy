# Open Source for Transparency and Innovation

Another critical factor leading to the choice of an open-source strategy is the need for transparency. This may sound obvious, but a critical need for transparency drives many organisations to adopt an open-source strategy. 

The reasons behind the high value placed on transparency may be plural: regulation, trust, security, etc. Making a project open source shares accountability with a broader audience. 

However, inviting shared oversight is a double-edged sword, as people may find critical defects that otherwise could have escaped the maintainers' scrutiny. This can create a demand for change. Yet, in the long run, defects are found—and hopefully fixed—which raises the overall quality of the project. 

Open-sourcing a project often comes as a token of goodwill because the shared oversight will ultimately assure that a specific product or algorithm conforms to its pitch. By giving access to the source code, interested parties can dissect and deeply audit a project, thus unveiling or nuancing any invalid claim.

## Open source for innovation 

As an immediate consequence of its existence, open source has proven crucial for fostering innovation in the software industry. Similarly to how many scientists campaign for public access to scientific literature, open-source advocates underline the importance of sharing source material to drive software development further. 

Even for industry leaders, open-sourcing software stimulates competition and encourages better approaches, which may directly benefit their primary business activities. Aspects we've seen earlier about open-source licensing relate directly to this last point.

The software industry is full of examples of large companies working on and improving open-source materials. Linux is notably the most successful open-source project to date. It has led to countless derivative works known as Linux distributions with some prevalent ones such as Ubuntu.

Linux's development has not only led to a robust operating system toolkit – it is also responsible for countless useful tools commonly used by all software engineers.

For example, a well-known success story in the development of Linux includes Git, a distributed version control system that has become the de-facto version control system for many open-source projects and proprietary software alike. 

Additionally, prominent actors in the software industry are also known for their open-source contributions. Google, for example, released Android in 2008 as the first major open-source mobile operating system derived from Linux. Today, Android powers more than 70% of the mobile phones across the entire world.

Furthermore, Microsoft has given birth to TypeScript, a widely used programming language on the Web, as well as Visual Studio Code: the most used integrated development environment (IDE) by a large margin. Visual Studio Code offers countless plugins, integrations and packages developed by a large community of enthusiasts.
