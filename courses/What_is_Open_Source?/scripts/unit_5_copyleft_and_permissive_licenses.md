# Copyleft and Permissive Licenses

Copyleft licenses ensure that the license is preserved through modified work. They ensure that new work remains open-source under the same conditions as the original work. Said differently, it isn't possible to add restrictions when redistributing the software. 

Yet, copyleft is also a spectrum. Strong copyleft licenses like GNU GPLv3 enforce that any modification or larger work is distributed in an open-source fashion and using the GNU GPLv3 license. 

In this context, the designation “larger work” refers to  any new software built using an open-source component. It could also designate another library or a commercial application that relies on open-source components.

GNU LGPLv3 is slightly more flexible and only enforces a copyleft on libraries. Any other larger work made using GNU LGPLv3 may be distributed under different terms and conditions. Yet, new software libraries – that is, reusable chunks of codes – must be made public and licensed under GNU LGPLv3.

Finally, the Mozilla Public License 2.0 – or MPL-2.0 in short, is a weak copyleft license. It enforces that any modification to an existing open-source file must be released publicly and licensed as MPL-2.0 or a stronger copyleft license such as GNU LGPLv3 or GNU GPLv3. It thus protects the original source code and ensures that what was created in an open source fashion remains open source. Yet, it is far more flexible regarding larger work constructed from it, libraries or not.

Permissive licenses differ in the permissions they provide. They also differ in the conditions they require for modifying source code and distributing it through a larger work. Hence, the Apache 2.0 license demands that any modification to a licensed code be thoroughly documented, contrary to MIT, which doesn't have such a requirement.

Regardless of their nature, copyleft or permissive, every open-source license will require that any code licensed by them is distributed with a proper license notice explicitly stating under what license they are distributed. Some, such as GNU GPLv3, GNU LGPLv3 and MPL-2.0, even enforce the source code availability when the software is distributed. Interestingly, this is not the case with Apache 2.0 and MIT which do not necessarily require the source code to be public when distributing software.

Interestingly, the MIT license is one of the rare licenses that does not grant users patent rights. This means that software or libraries licensed as MIT may end up in a larger work under a patent — even though the original code wasn't patented to begin with. 

So far, all the other licensing schemes we've seen prevent that either by granting explicit patent rights and/or by including patent retaliation clauses in the license.
