# Non-Code Contributions to Open Source

## Ideas 

Contributions in the form of ideas are as important as adding to the code itself. Typically, open-source projects publicly discuss design issues and project evolutions. This open discourse gives users and contributors an opportunity to share insightful feedback. 

Direct feedback from users is immensely valuable for project maintainers because building software without users proves complicated.

Platforms such as GitHub provide discussion threads, polls, Q&A and so forth to facilitate conversations. Many projects also set up more synchronous communication channels such as Discord or Telegram. It may sometimes not feel like it, but hanging around on a Discord server and participating in discussions offers a meaningful contribution.

## Documentation 

When project conversations lead to actionable items, the discussions effectively become documentation. Yet, often, this initial form of documentation proves generally very rough. Transforming these informal discussions into intelligible documentation is a key aspect of software documentation, making up another way to contribute to open source.

Projects typically divide documentation along four dimensions:
Tutorials: meant to teach basics and provide a learning experience; How-to guides: provide concrete steps to solve a particular problem; Explanations: general theoretical knowledge to help deepen comprehension; References: practical information to come back to for detail.

Writing good documentation is hard. Even harder is to keep documentation up-to-date as context evolves and parts move. While many software components can be automatically checked through tools and compiler rules, documentation often depends on human interventions. 

Users are typically the first ones exposed to documentation and, thereby, the ones stumbling upon quirks and mistakes. 

Fixing mistakes as they're found is an easy way to contribute to a project and something maintainers are almost always looking for. Feedback on documentation is also generally welcomed. Users are the primary audience for software documentation; it is written for them. 
It is thus only normal that they help tailor it to their comprehension.

## Design 

Do you know what's better than good documentation? Beautiful, good documentation! When software has a user interface, the icons, typography, backgrounds, and layouts become integral to its development. 

Yet, graphic design demands a different skillset than software development. And it is rare to find individuals with both skills. 

So open source maintainers often appreciate contributors who can help with the design. We’ll talk more about design in a moment.
