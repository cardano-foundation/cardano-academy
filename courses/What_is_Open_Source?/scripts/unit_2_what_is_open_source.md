# What is Open Source?

Open source is a decentralised software development model focused on public collaboration. What does this mean? The term “open source” refers to any form of public access to the source material of a particular product design. It embeds ideas of open exchange, community-driven development, public governance and, of course, public access to and distribution of the source material. 

While the concept of open course is still mainly present in the software industry, it extends to other engineering areas and sciences such as electronics, automotive, robotics and medicine.

In this course, we will mainly discuss open source in the context of software engineering, looking at the case in which source code is publicly available. Open-source code can be used, enhanced, shared and modified under specific conditions. This approach contrasts with the more traditional, proprietary software development methods that results in what we often call “closed-source software”. 

While publicly available, open-source projects cannot generally be modified by just anyone. Projects are typically safeguarded by teams of maintainers whose role is to not only develop the project further but also to assess and manage contributions made to the project. 

Maintainers are typically the main contributors to open-source projects. And they define the framework for contributing to it. Usually, maintainers themselves have a direct interest in the project for their business activities, and they see open source as a way to enhance or accelerate the project's development.
