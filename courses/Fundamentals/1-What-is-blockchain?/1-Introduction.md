Welcome everyone to the Cardano Academy. This Blockchain Fundamentals course is intended for anyone new to blockchain and ‘crypto’. 

Cryptography is all about hiding, or encoding, information so only the intended recipient can read a message. The origins of cryptography go all the way back to carvings found on the walls of tombs in Egypt around 1900 BC. As technology and computer systems evolved, cryptography advanced too and gave us the building blocks that enable blockchains and the cryptocurrencies that run on them today. 

In this course we’ll explore the origins of blockchain and review well known projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano. We’ll go through the differences and similarities between them, help you get started and review some of the business use cases for blockchain and cryptocurrencies. We’ll suggest some tools to help you decide if blockchain is a good fit for your business.

Before we jump in, we should say there is a glossary to help you better understand some of the terminology in the course.
