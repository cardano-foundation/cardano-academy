**What is blockchain?**

You can think of Blockchain as being like a trust broker for different parties who cannot, or will not, trust each other. Traditionally there would be a central party everyone defers to, but with blockchain trust is placed in a decentralized protocol. Hence, the terms ‘trustless’ and ‘permissionless’ you will often hear.

A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger of transactions. What does this mean? When people use a cryptocurrency, they're really exchanging ownership of a digital asset. The transaction is logged on a blockchain, not stored in one central location but rather on many different nodes all around the world. Each node has its own copy of the blockchain so when a new transaction is executed, each node updates its copy. Anyone with an internet connection can exchange assets across continents with a mouse click.

Trustless transactions are enabled between parties with all past transactions logged and verified on the blockchain. There is no need for an intermediary, such as a bank, to verify transactions. Blockchains are immutable, meaning the transactions can’t be altered or reversed without updating the entire chain, and updates need the consensus of most of the network. A dishonest actor would need to have 51% control of the network to be successful. The cost of acquiring such control is so expensive it is a deterrent in itself.

Blockchains are transparent and auditable as all transactions are a public ‘single source of truth’. You can inspect most transaction details with an explorer tool. Blockchain has proven secure to all manner of attacks since its inception. It is extremely resilient as, even if some of its peers go offline for whatever reason, the rest will continue functioning. The immutability, and security, of a blockchain is directly related to its decentralization. 

Measuring decentralization is not straightforward, but the Edinburgh Decentralisation Index (EDI), a project run by the Blockchain Technology Laboratory (BTL) at the University of Edinburgh, provides a useful reference point. Any credible measurement must consider network structure, node distribution, how governance is handled, etc. This segues us nicely to what is known as the ‘blockchain trilemma’. 


The blockchain trilemma refers to the trade-off between three critical aspects of blockchain technology. It argues that a blockchain cannot simultaneously have security, scalability and decentralization and generally can only satisfy two out of the three of these requirements. This is an ongoing challenge researchers and developers strive to overcome. There is some promising research in the course of being implemented. Many technical obstacles have already been overcome in this fledgling industry.  

We should note that there are three main types of blockchain: 

- A public (permissionless) blockchain where anyone can participate with no restrictions. Most cryptocurrencies run on public blockchains governed by rules and consensus algorithms. This is the focus of this course.
- A private (permissioned) blockchain where an entity dictates who has access.
- A federated or consortium blockchain where consensus is controlled by a preselected set of nodes.
