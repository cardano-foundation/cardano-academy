Many businesses now have an ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) mandate. Adopting blockchain for their ESG data allows businesses to demonstrate trust, accuracy, and regulatory compliance. Blockchain's decentralized nature means their ESG reporting is more reliable and also verifiable. 

Proof of ESG is an example of a business that uses blockchain technology to verify ESG data. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures that once ESG data is recorded, it cannot be tampered with, ensuring data integrity. This level of transparency and trust in ESG data is missing from traditional ESG reporting methods.

The Cardano Foundation has partnered with Veritree who are the world’s first, fully integrated platform for tree restoration through blockchain. There is also a Sustainable Ada project who compiled the Cardano Impact Report 2023 describing how blockchain is recalibrating the way we view value, identity, positive social and environmental impact.
