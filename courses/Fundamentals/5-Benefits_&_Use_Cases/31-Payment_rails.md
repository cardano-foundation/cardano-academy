A payment rail is the digital infrastructure enabling money transfers. TradFi, or Traditional finance, is made up of centralised institutions who control the flow of funds between permissioned parties in exchange for transaction fees. These fees are usually high compared to blockchain alternatives, usually because of the lack of credible remittance alternatives. 

On a blockchain, counterparties transfer value on a public ledger that records and validates the details publicly at the same time for everyone. Blockchain disrupts the current hierarchical financial system by ‘killing the middleman’. The middleman, in this context, can be any of the following intermediaries: 

- Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) networks, or equivalent fund transfer systems.
 							
- Interbank networks – such as the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), automated clearing house (ACH) and Fedwire payment system among others
							
- Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), the communication network for both ACH and wire transfers. 
						
- Credit card networks like like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Visa is now enabling Crypto withdrawals on a large scale.
 							
- Fintech applications like Stripe, PayPal, Revolut, etc. which connect to the ACH or RTGS networks to settle payments also now enable users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. 

Blockchain transactions are irreversible but custom logic can be codified in smart contracts to allow some recourse in the event of a dispute, failure to deliver service,  or other form of trust breach. Blockchains are permissionless, and inclusive for anyone with an internet connection.
