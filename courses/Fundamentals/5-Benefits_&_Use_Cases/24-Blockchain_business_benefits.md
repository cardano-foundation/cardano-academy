For the rest of the course, we’ll focus on the business side of things, listing the types of use cases blockchain enables and some of the business models which have sprung up. By the end, you should be able to conclude if blockchain is the right fit for your business. 

Blockchain has the following benefits for business:

**Transaction times**: Compared to traditional inter-bank transfers, Cardano has demonstrated it can transfer thousands of digital assets to multiple recipients globally and settled in minutes, for minimal fees. There is no verification required from a central authority or clearing house.

**Cost savings**: A blockchain network reduces expenses in several ways:
• The network is self-policed by network participants through ‘inclusive accountability’.
• ‘Killing the middleman’ as intermediaries are no longer required. Participants exchange value directly.
• Duplication of effort is eliminated because the shared ledger provides a single source of truth.

**Security**: Blockchain inherently protects against interference, fraud, and hacking.
 
**Privacy**: The Cardano Foundation offers a digital identity wallet that prioritizes security, privacy, and interoperability to drive adoption and support existing ecosystems. Users can securely generate, update, deactivate, and restore Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs). Zero Knowledge proofs and other cryptographic primitives enable selective disclosure and other advanced privacy capabilities.

Blockchains can be **permissioned or permissionless**. Some companies use permissioned blockchains to achieve privacy. Permissioned blockchain provides each participant with a unique identity, enabling the use of policies to restrict participation and  access to sensitive details. Permissioned blockchains are adopted sometimes out of necessity to comply with data protection regulations, for example to protect medical records in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

**Auditability** with a shared public ledger provides a ‘single pane of glass’ for monitoring and auditing transactions.

**Operational efficiency**: cryptocurrencies, and the blockchains they run on, operate 24/7 with no concept of ‘business days’ or public holidays. Tokenization of assets streamlines near instant transfer of ownership.

Smart contracts can contain **business terms and conditions** that could be written in a way to be self-executing and self-enforcing. This offers more security and efficiency than traditional paper contracts.
