Tokenization is the on-chain digital representation of real world assets. Native assets, or tokens, are the smallest pieces of data on the Cardano blockchain. They are defined by three things: a name, a minting policy and an amount. 

Just one example where tokenization offers a solution is around the diamond mining industry. Most people have heard of the story of ‘Blood diamonds’ mined in war zones and sold to finance all kinds of nefarious activity. The establishment of the Kimberley Process in 2003 is a multilateral trade regime that outlines safeguards for preventing and eliminating blood diamonds from the global supply chain. This includes some required criteria to certify diamonds are from legitimate sources. Blockchain technology is an obvious platform for such requirements. An immutable audit trail enables compliance and retailers can verify suppliers credentials.

NMKR, an NFT and tokenization service, partnered with Tiamonds to bring tokenized diamonds to Cardano and also provide user-friendly plug-and-play tools for projects.

NFTs can be used for many other different use cases in a blockchain powered digital economy. 
Fungible tokens can be used in a wide range of different contexts: 

- DeFi DAO tokens – for example, a utility token can be integral to a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Utilizing a non-custodial system, NFT-backed loans can be facilitiated, enabling users to leverage their digital assets
- Loyalty Points to reward and incentivize readers.
- Wrapped assets. For example, Wrapped BTC is a synthetic version of Bitcoin, represented by a token, built and deployed through a smart contract, on other blockchains.
- Meme coins are tokens usually based on a joke, rather than real world utility. 
- Staking - Native tokens can be staked to participate in a protocol’s operation. In return users benefit from yield farming opportunities, where users can stake Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens to earn additional rewards, usually in the form of the platform’s native token. 

NFT’s also have a wide variety of use cases:
- Profile pictures
- Digital art
- Collectibles
- Digital Twins - a digital copy of something in the real world.
- POAP NFTs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) shows you attended, or took part, in an event. 
- Fractional ownership of physical assets like property, fine art, etc
- Gaming… NFTs can be used in all types of creative ways in Gaming, which segues us nicely to our next video…
