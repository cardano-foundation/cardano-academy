When considering if blockchain is the right solution for your business, there is much to consider. The following questions are a starting point for deeper discussions:			

1. Is the process a once off, or one that is an ongoing repeatable process?  Can it be fully automated? If it can only be partially automated, is it worth pursuing?
 							
2. How many stakeholders are involved in the process? Do they all need to be honest? For example, is a 5 of 7 multi-signature sufficient for consensus? What is the threshold? 
 							
3. Are there multiple disparate data sources? Blockchain may help consolidate different types of data and help ensure data consistency. 
						
4. Is there a value transfer? Can an old process be streamlined with blockchain?
 							
5. Is there a need for immutability, with permanent records?

6. Do you need reliable performance? For example, Cardano transactions fees are deterministic, meaning you can predict them accurately in advance. The same transaction will not incur different fees at different times.

7 What is the right strategy for your business? Blue ocean or red ocean?
For example, Cardano successfully executed a blue ocean strategy. A red ocean strategy would have involved forking Bitcoin or Ethereum and competing directly as a proof of work blockchain. Cardano's blue ocean strategy involved taking a first principles academic research-based approach. As we discussed, much of Cardano is custom built including many industry firsts. For example, the first provably secure proof-of-stake consensus protocol, Ouroboros. The first liquid, non-custodial staking model, the first eUtxO accounting model at scale. 
    
8. What industry are you in? Is ESG (Environmental, social, and corporate governance) a requirement or a ‘nice to have’?

9. Have you catered for blockchains drawbacks?

Blockchain technology is not always a silver bullet. For example, immutability can be frustrating when you need to make corrections to earlier work. Blockchains use public key cryptography to secure your assets. If you lose your seed phrase, you could lose your entire funds. Settlement time of ten minutes may not be ideal if you are selling ice cream on a warm day with long queues. There are workarounds and best practices to these issues, but it’s important you are aware of potential hiccups.

There are different frameworks for assessing solutions for your business idea. It is probably best to use a mix of frameworks to assess your use case. 
Porter’s Five Forces, for example, describes five key sources of competitive pressure within a given industry. You could use these to weigh up the competitiveness of your new product in the market. The five considerations are: threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new substitutes and competitive rivalry.  	

You may also conduct a SWOT analysis. Considering the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats is another technique for assessing key aspects of your business. 	

For an emerging technology like blockchain, it’s perhaps wise to review the Gartner Hype Cycle which is a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of a technology. Views of where Cardano currently sits on the cycle are subjective, and people may interpret the chart differently but it might help with your overall strategy to understand where real business value and opportunity exist. 
				
While many people loathe the idea of focusing on price alone, if your business depends on blockchain, then you must appreciate that many blockchains are intrinsically tied to their native currency. The nature of cryptocurrency market cycles is not something that should be ignored. Many businesses perish each bear market, underestimating the market swings. The famous ‘Wall Street Cheat Sheet’ is an aid to traders in understanding and navigating market movements. It offers some insight into the psychological aspects of trading, but perhaps relatable to anyone working in the industry.

These are just a sample of the frameworks and tools you can use to decide if Blockchain is right for your business.
