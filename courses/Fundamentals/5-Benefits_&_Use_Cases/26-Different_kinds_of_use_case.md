Now we have seen how different blockchains work, what can they actually be used for? The use cases are only limited by your imagination. 

Research by firms such as Deloitte and McKinsey believe blockchain has use cases across all verticals, while Gartner predicts blockchain’s business value will grow to $176 billion by 2025 and $3.1 trillion by 2030. Most use cases for blockchain feature some, or all, of the following characteristics:				 
**Digital scarcity**: Digital assets can have a fixed or variable supply. Native currencies like bitcoin and ada have deflationary models with rewards decreasing over time. Much of the NFT craze is fueled by speculation on the scarcity of assets tokenized on-chain. 
 							
**Payment Rails** enable the secure and efficient transfer of value. Legacy remittance infrastructure is outdated, expensive and opaque. Migrants sending money home to developing world countries are charged extortionate rates. Credit card transactions can take up to seven business days to settle behind the scenes. Sending funds over a blockchain is faster, cheaper and transparent. For example, Cardano’s eUTxO model enables thousands of digital assets to be transferred to multiple recipients in the same transaction. See eutxo.org for visualisation of blocks being minted ‘live’. 

**Distributed ledger** allows anyone to track the origin, ownership, production process, transportation, and storage of both tokenized physical assets and digital assets. Crucially, DLT, or distributed ledger technology, can do all this without the need for a central authority.
