**Hard Forks & Soft Forks**

You may ask yourself, if there is no central authority and nobody is in charge, then how can a blockchain be updated? In a truly decentralized network, changes are implemented with soft forks or hard forks. It is slightly more nuanced than that, as some chains implement these forks very differently.

Any software needs regular updates to fix issues, boost performance and protect itself from new attack types. Anyone who uses Windows can’t escape the regular updates on *Patch Tuesday*, the colloquial term for Microsoft's Update Tuesday that pops up on the second Tuesday of every month. In the world of blockchain , there are similar updates called ‘forks’.

Since blockchains are decentralized networks, it works best when all participating nodes follow the same rules and run the same version of the node. These rules are known as the protocol, and a fork can change a protocol’s behaviour by different extents. There are two main types of fork in blockchain , soft and hard forks.

**Soft forks** are backwards compatible upgrades. They’re ‘soft’ in that they don’t necessarily interrupt the regular functioning of the network. Think of it like an optional update on your laptop.

A **Hard Fork** is a more drastic change to a protocol. Generally, nodes that don’t update to the new version will be unable to process transactions or add new blocks to the **same** blockchain. Hard forks are used to implement a major update to an existing protocol, or as the name suggests, fork a blockchain in two. The old one continues functioning as before, while a new blockchain is also created with different, sometimes contentious, features. 

A good example was the Ethereum hard fork which occurred after a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation, known as a DAO,  was hacked due to a Solidity vulnerability and approx 3.6 million ETH was stolen. It caused a split in the Ethereum community as there was no consensus, or governance mechanism to decide, on how to proceed. Eventually, Ethereum chose to reverse the hack and refund the ETH. Ethereum Classic adopted a ‘code is law’ stance, and believed those who lost their ETH should take their medicine. This eventually led to a contentious hard fork, giving birth to two separate Ethereum chains, Ethereum and ‘Ethereum Classic’.

Hard forks are not just technical events. There can be various intangibles which motivate communities. Ideally they are planned and unanimous, but in some contexts they can be sudden, controversial and traumatic. Another example was the Bitcoin fork where the scaling conundrum led to heated debates which resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash, a fork of the original Bitcoin protocol with an increase in maximum block size to 32MB. Over the years, Bitcoin has been forked over a hundred times!
