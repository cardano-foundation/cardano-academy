**The 3 Generations of Blockchain**

Now that we’ve covered Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is  a good time to explain the three generations of blockchain. Since Satoshi’s white paper in 2009, blockchain technology has evolved over three distinct generations, each evolving with new features and innovative capabilities. 

Bitcoin ushered in the **first generation of blockchain** using proof of work to validate transactions. Miners require, by design, ever increasing amounts of computing power to compete to generate new blocks. Bitcoin is energy intensive but also incredibly secure. It has been notoriously reluctant to implement new features for fear it will increase the attack surface and lead to a less secure network.

The **second generation of blockchain** was spearheaded by Ethereum. It introduced programmability to blockchains through smart contracts written in Solidity. Suddenly, Blockchain was not just about moving currencies back and forth, smart contracts led to a proliferation of dApps facilitating a broad range of new use cases we’ll discuss shortly. Ethereum started as a proof-of-work consensus and transitioned to proof-of-stake in Sept 2022. 

So called **third generation blockchains** extend on past projects, with a new breed of blockchains such as Cardano, Polkadot and Algorand. This generation placed more emphasis on scalability, interoperability and governance. Cardano was the first proof-of-stake blockchain to offer the same security guarantees as Bitcoin. It has followed a research-driven approach to building its blockchain, with many novel features and solutions. This leads us nicely to our next few videos which will explore Cardano’s differentiators in more detail.
