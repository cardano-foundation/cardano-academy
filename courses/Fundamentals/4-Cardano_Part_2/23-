One of the cornerstones of Cardano is decentralisation, but true decentralisation must be realised across three plains: block production, consensus networking and governance. Cardano has traditionally managed update proposals and trialled governance tooling through two mechanisms. 

The Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIP) help steer the boat from a technical standpoint. Engineers and product designers propose reusable technical solutions to common problems.  

The other mechanism is Project Catalyst, a community-driven innovation fund. Cardano holders can propose projects, review, comment and vote on them. Community funds are allocated to the most promising initiatives. Catalyst takes an experimental approach, and the process has been tweaked and improved over standalone funding rounds. Governance on Cardano is still in its infancy, and we are now in the phase of implementing on-chain mechanisms to realise the vision for the Age of Votaire. Many of the learnings taken from the Catalyst journey are fed into CIP-1694. 

CIP-1694, named after the year of Voltaire’s birth, is a proposal for bootstrapping on-chain governance. Back when Cardano was formed, there was a tripartite structure with Emurgo, Cardano Foundation (CF) and IOG. It was always intended to transition to a members-based organization (MBO) that would manage the bureaucracy of protocol governance. Throughout 2023 and 2024, IOG and the CF ran workshops all around the globe to gather feedback and refine CIP-1694. To summarise, the proposal focuses on three different categories:

1. The idea of representation. Direct representation is where an ada holder personally votes, and delegated authority where you hand someone else your vote. In CIP 1694, this role is called a DRep, a delegated representative. 

2. A constitution describes the guardrails for the system, to insure some degree of stability. For Cardano, this constitution can be drafted to be machine understandable, so once a voting mechanism is in place, the constitution can then be ratified, hashed and embedded into a transaction.
 
3. Institutions set standards and facilitate a review process by domain experts, acting as the custodians of knowledge and best practices. 

One members based organization, or MBO, focussing on Cardano governance is called Intersect. It is an aggregation point for anyone interested to meet and debate issues, manage Cardano’s roadmap, facilitate the development of strategies to achieve key milestones, and attract suitable developers and entities to build tooling, services, critical infrastructure, etc. While Intersect is the anchor institution for Voltaire, it is just one. Another MBO is PRAGMA which attempts to foster an alternative open-source ecosystem for Cardano and other blockchains. 

In summary, while liquid democracy is not a new concept, and constitutions have been written before, nothing on this scale has been attempted in the crypto space. The following are some of the key milestones for the Age of Voltaire: 

- In Q4 of 2023, Cardano wallets Lace, Yoroi, and others announced integration into the Governance Tool (GovTool) for Voltaire testing within SanchoNet. 

- The Interim Constitution was drafted, providing a framework for the Constitutional Committee to function during the bootstrapping phase. 

- Throughout 2024, there was ongoing community consultation through another series of workshops to discuss and debate Cardano's Constitution. Feedback from the workshops was fed into the Constitutional Convention, which took place in Buenos Aries and Nairobi, Kenya  in December 2024. Delegates representing over 50 countries voted in favour of the Constitution.

- The DRep Pioneer Program supports prospective candidates on understanding the DRep role, code of conduct, the delegation process, how to become a DRep, DRep rewards, engaging with the community among other topics. 

- Intersect provides similar support for the Constitutional Committee, ensuring that members are trained for their roles and are able to execute effectively.

- There are several working groups and committees with different remits such as: the Membership and Community Committee, Technical Steering Committee, Open Source Committee, Parameter Committee, Vision Committee, Budget Committee, Product Committee and Cardano Civics Committee.

- The Chang upgrade in September 2024 was another Cardano milestone as it implemented a minimum viable on-chain governance. The Plomin upgrade followed in January 2025 where all on-chain governance actions were turned on. The constitution was subsequently ratified in an on-chain vote when a governance action was submitted and passed the required threshold.
