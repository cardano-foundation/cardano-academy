We talked about the Lightning Network on Bitcoin earlier. Hydra is another Layer 2 scaling solution tailored for Cardano.

Hydra introduces isomorphic state channels to increase throughput with reduced transaction fees and storage needs. Hydra is developed using principled, evidence-based research making it easier to perform transactions off-chain while utilizing the main-chain ledger for secure settlement. 

Hydra can sound very complicated but lets demystify some of the jargon. Let’s first clarify what ‘isomorphic state channels’ are. ‘Iso’ is a prefix meaning equal, like you may have heard the term isometric, meaning equal measurements. ‘Morphic’ is related to shape or form. So isomorphic means having the same structure and properties. 

‘State channels’ extend the idea of payment channels to also support smart-contracts over off-chain channels. Participants in the channel can now, in addition to traditional transactional payments, execute scripts to handle complex logic, off-chain, before committing the result back to the layer 1 mainchain.

Participants lock funds into a smart contract. They can then transact with others in the state channel, off-chain, in whatever fashion meets their use case. Afterwards, the outcome is settled on-chain, without requiring the full transaction history of what occurred off-chain in the meantime. 

Developers can leverage Cardano’s proven infrastructure to develop wallets and dApps that communicate with the layer 2 system, drastically reducing the learning curve for Hydra. 

While Hydra is being developed in collaboration with the Ouroboros protocol and the Cardano ledger, it may also be used with other systems that have the same properties as Cardano. Hydra replicates the main chain’s functionality while minimizing friction for users, but still allows the flexibility of having a different fee structure and timing constraints on the layer 2. 

Hydra gels seamlessly with Cardano as extended UTXO and smart contracts allow developers to build rich isomorphic state channels. In comparison, the Lightning Network faces some friction as Bitcoin does not support programmability.
