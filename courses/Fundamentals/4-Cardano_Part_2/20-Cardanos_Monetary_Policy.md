You may often hear the term tokenomics in regards to cryptocurrencies. This is referring to the economic model of a coin or token, including its  total supply, circulating supply and initial distribution among other factors. Cardano had a very fair token distribution, in comparison to its counterparts with 80% of ada owned by the public.

The total supply of 45 billion Ada refers to the amount of ada that will only ever exist and approximately 35 billion of that is the current circulating supply. Cardano's monetary policy is a carefully considered approach to ensure the inflation rate remains low in the long term. This is achieved by setting a parameter to control the maximum percentage of ada that can be released in a given period. The Cardano monetary policy is the result of academic research on the game theory associated with inflation, including a rigorous analysis of the effects of Cardano's circulating supply on its overall value. 

Cardano's monetary policy is designed to incentivize stake pool operators to participate in the staking model to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the network. Ada holders who delegate and stake pool operators are rewarded for their support with a proportion of ada each epoch, in addition to transaction fees. 

Transaction fees are deterministic, or predictable, for developers interacting with Cardano. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Cardano handles fees a little differently. Fees do not go straight to the block producer. Instead, they are pooled and distributed to all stake pools that created blocks during an epoch. 

Incentivizing users to participate in staking and governance is not an exact science. There are examples of blockchains who have suffered low participation numbers and have switched to a model that pays participants. 

Cardano's monetary expansion depends on a long-term commitment by stake pool operators to support the chain. It is the SPOs who run the cardano-node, which is the heartbeat of the network. The incentive system does not significantly change over time, and while staking rewards gradually depreciate, transaction fees should increase as adoption grows. SPOs can also receive rewards by providing similar support for sidechains and partner chains. More about that shortly. 

Cardano's monetary policy focuses on two main points:

1. Staking rewards for those participating in the network as discussed above.
2. Funding the treasury.

Staking rewards come from two sources. Fees from every transaction and from all blocks produced during each epoch go into a virtual pot. A fixed percentage of the remaining ada reserves is also added to this pot every epoch. Ada reserves is the difference between total supply and circulating supply. That percentage (denoted œÅ) is known as the monetary expansion. It is a protocol parameter currently set at 0.3%, but may be updated in future. 

A set percentage of the pot is then sent to the treasury and the rest is used as epoch rewards. 

The treasury is another important keystone of Cardano's monetary policy. The goal is that there will always be funds available to develop Cardano. The funds should be accessible through governance mechanisms where proposals are voted on by ada holders.  Funds are regularly sent to the treasury to ensure it is always topped up.

There are many other parameters you can review online. We'll look at them in greater detail in future courses.
