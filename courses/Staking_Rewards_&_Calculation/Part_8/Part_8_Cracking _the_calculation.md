The Foundation generates a report alongside every new version of the repository.  

Contributions to this repository are not limited to code alone; people can add data, links, documentation, and insights regarding the substantial differences observed in some epochs. The repository itself follows a test-driven approach, so it makes sense to begin by creating tests, such as those related to specific pool rewards in specific epochs. The Foundation has created the report for the treasury only, but we see potential to introduce this type of report for the other constituents of the ADA-Pots, as well as detailed reports about selected stake pools and member rewards in the future.  

Most of the time, the treasury value averages around 3,500 ada higher than the formula predicts. The pool reap rule directs unclaimable pool deposits, such as when a pool retires and the associated stake address has already been deregistered, back to the treasury. Additionally, each pool can earn a maximum ada value for each epoch. 

Moving forward, the Foundation intends to utilize the reports and interactive charts coming from this repository to explain ada tokenomics to regulators, businesses, and institutions.  

An open source approach always enriches the ecosystem, offering mutual benefits to all involved parties while simultaneously fostering transparency and improving the likelihood of widespread adoption of blockchain technology. The Cardano Foundation, therefore, plans to continue open sourcing repositories and solutions with a view to promoting Cardanoâ€™s open source maturity.
