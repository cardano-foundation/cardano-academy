To ensure the stability and reliability of this project, unit tests have been implemented. You can access the detailed test reports from the project’s GitHub repository. We also generate for each version of this project calculation reports. These reports are generated by the unit tests and contain the calculation results compared to the actual values.  

The repo also contains (as requested by the community) a section which is called "treasury development" and it lists for each epoch the actual amount of the ADA put into the treasury compared to the 20% that it should be (in relative and absolute numbers). Also included is the total amount that was paid on top of the treasury cut (because of the ledger rules) to the treasury over all epochs until now (4.2 million ADA).
