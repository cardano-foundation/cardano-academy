**Introduction**

This course will reference many of the concepts and terms already covered in Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA) so you should have completed, or at least understood that content. 

You are encouraged to sit the CBCA exam and get certified. Please note all Cardano Academy courses are supported by an ever expanding glossary. Consult this companion guide if you come across a term alien to you, or just need to refresh your memory on a complicated topic. 

For this course, we are focusing on writing smart contracts, or scripts, on Cardano using Aiken: The modern smart contract platform for Cardano. Before we get coding, we should understand what went before. We will briefly look at how smart contracts evolved. For each blockchain, we will review its scripting layer and the underlying account model to get a better appreciation of Aiken. We’ll then get hands on coding some simple Aiken validators, highlighting key features and concepts. We’ll end by suggesting some next steps and useful resources.

First let's zoom out and understand the Cardano blockchain stack and where the various components sit on it.
